# TODOs
- Create "url_encode" and "pad" (make a string at least x long, should work with numbers too) helpers
- Create a numeric incrementing provider.
- Allow templates in declare section
- Allow templates in select queries (for provides and logs)
- Logger enhancements: Allow loggers to have access to the "stats" (stats.rtt) and add "method" and "url" (parsed url); allow logger to have multiple select clauses and log to the first one in which the `where` matches; allow to query on array.length
- Provide a means of having different provider parameters based on condition (eg. for "beta" I want files x, password y). Allow templates in file path to reference environment variables
- Provide a means of terminating a test with a logger
- Different endpoint parameters selected randomly based on percentages
- Improve documentation
- Allow mathematical expressions in template
- Allow repeat to be a random number within a range
- Log connection timeouts, connection errors, etc. to stats
- Log when a request is waiting for a provider
- Have the Dockerfile and sh script cross compile for windows as well (see https://stackoverflow.com/a/39184296)
- Update endpoint bodys to be an enum of string or json. Json string values are an enum of a string or reference. Strings can be templates make sure the stringify helper is publicly accessible.
- Get rid of all panics, unreachable, etc. Instead there should be a means of killing the test in those cases. This is a prerequisite to having a server which runs load tests on demand
- Create a Visual Studio Code language extension for the loadtest file schema
- Make files referenced by a file provider relative to the configuraton file. Also allow absolute paths (not sure if it currently works)
- Add cli option for results
- every minute we print stats to console, also write those results to disk, overwriting the previous file every minute
- add config options: for client: request timeout, standard headers, keepalive time, dns resolution thread pool; general: bucket size, auto-sized providers start size
- add `files` body provider
- allow multipart uploads
- update `mod_interval` code so that multiple `scale_fn`s can be added so that it handles the transition from one fn to the next, rather than using `Stream::chain`. This is important because, currently, if a provider value is delayed for a long period of time, it will start on the next `mod_interval` even though enough time may have passed that it should skip several `mod_interval`s. Should also help in allowing `load_patterns` to be dynamically changed during test run
- add more tests - unit and integration - get code coverage
- track system health (sysinfo crate) perhaps event loop latency and determine if system is overloaded
- add in machine clustering. Machines should open up a secure connection using a PSK
- allow load_patterns/config to change while a test is running. Monitor the load test config file for changes
- add test monitoring. Possibly use tui for terminal output. Have webserver which will display a dashboard
