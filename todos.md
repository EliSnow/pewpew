# TODOs
- Make declare section use expressions. Make sure collect can only be used in declare
- Add a way to run an endpoint a single time for testing purposes and print out the raw http data (request and response). This should be smart enough to handle calling any other endpoints which may be needed for depenedent providers
- Provide a means of having different provider parameters based on condition (eg. for "beta" I want files x, password y). Allow templates in file path to reference environment variables
- Clarify in the documentation where templates are used vs expressions
- Log when a request is waiting for a provider
- Logger enhancements: get rid of global logger restriction, and allow endpoints to send to it
- Add ability to parse substring/strings out of a string with a regex. If no capture groups then just a single string will return if it matches. If there are capture groups and object will be provided with the capture group number or name as the key and the matche as the value. It should skip capture group 0.
- Provide a means of terminating a test with a logger
- Different endpoint parameters selected randomly based on percentages
- Allow mathematical expressions in template
- Allow repeat to be a random number within a range
- Have the Dockerfile and sh script cross compile for windows as well (see https://stackoverflow.com/a/39184296)
- Update endpoint bodys to be an enum of string or json. Json string values are an enum of a string or reference. Strings can be templates make sure the stringify helper is publicly accessible.
- Get rid of all panics, unreachable, etc. Instead there should be a means of killing the test in those cases. This is a prerequisite to having a server which runs load tests on demand
- Create a Visual Studio Code language extension for the loadtest file schema
- Make files referenced by a file provider relative to the configuraton file. Also allow absolute paths (not sure if it currently works)
- Add cli option for results
- every minute we print stats to console, also write those results to disk, overwriting the previous file every minute
- add `files` body provider
- allow multipart uploads
- update `mod_interval` code so that multiple `scale_fn`s can be added so that it handles the transition from one fn to the next, rather than using `Stream::chain`. This is important because, currently, if a provider value is delayed for a long period of time, it will start on the next `mod_interval` even though enough time may have passed that it should skip several `mod_interval`s. Should also help in allowing `load_patterns` to be dynamically changed during test run
- add more tests - unit and integration - get code coverage
- track system health (sysinfo crate) perhaps event loop latency and determine if system is overloaded
- add in machine clustering. Machines should open up a secure connection using a PSK
- allow load_patterns/config to change while a test is running. Monitor the load test config file for changes
- add test monitoring. Possibly use tui for terminal output. Have webserver which will display a dashboard
