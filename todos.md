# TODOs
- refactor stats parser so all console messages are printed from one location
  - need to log errors for try run
  - update results viewer to handle new stats format
- v0.6 - Breaking Change - Make tags a global within a select. Add `tags` to the list of reserved keywords
- v0.6 - Breaking Change - Make the stats file not be an array of jsons but just a log file of appended jsons (so the file doesn't need to be rewritten in whole with each bucket). Will also need to update the results viewer
- v0.6 - Breaking Change - Change the repeat option on file and range providers default to true
- v0.6 - ensure templates for file paths only reference static providers and vars
- v0.6 - Remove stats-file-format cli flag
- v0.6 - Integrate provider stats in with regular stats so they're in the stats file and deprecate the `log_provider_stats` general config option.
- add more tests - unit and integration - get code coverage -- add in negative tests
  - split config parser into sub-crate and add in unit tests
  - add in integration test which drops connections before the body is fully sent
- Create a try run viewer. Version > 0.5.
- Have a `stats` sub-command to read, merge, and print aggregate stats summaries. Also the ability to convert a json to html. Version > 0.5.
- Have ability to include providers and endpoints (and any provider dependencies) from another config file. Version > 0.5.
- Have a way to set an SLA for an endpoint and visualize that in the results. Also have a stats.SLA property that could be used to key logging off of.
- Add metrics for bytes sent/received per endpoint (total per bucket?)
- Have the Dockerfile and sh script cross compile for windows as well (see https://stackoverflow.com/a/39184296, https://github.com/est31/msvc-wine-rust)
- Add in machine clustering. Machines should open up a secure connection using a PSK
- track system health (sysinfo crate) perhaps event loop latency and determine if system is overloaded
- Create a Visual Studio Code language extension for the loadtest file schema. Perhaps we only need a json schema (https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/json#_json-schemas-settings)
- Tokio: v0.2 - use tokio-signal instead of ctrl c crate. Previous issues (https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio/issues/1000) have been resolved
