# Viewing Results

At the end of every test, Pewpew creates a `stats-*.json` file with aggregated statistics from the test. To view the stats:

1. Go [here](./results-viewer/index.html) to open the results viewer.
2. Drag the `stats-*.json` file onto the page.


<!-- 1. Download a local copy of the test viewer from [here](https://github.com/fs-eng/SystemTestTools/raw/master/pewpew-results-viewer/dist/index.html). Make sure to save it as a `.html` file.
2. Open the viewer in a browser.
3. Drag the `stats-*.json` file onto the page. -->
